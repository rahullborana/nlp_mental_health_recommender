"Hi ChelseaBlue01 and welcome to the forum.  I'm sorry to hear that your diagnosis is causing further anxiety. I think this is understandable as a diagnosis can be a mixture of relief but also further anxiety? It's good that you have come to a forum for peer-to-peer support. I'm wondering if you have managed to check the topics section yet, which is on the right column side of the forum? There are many useful support posts here also, which may be of help? Staying positive and optimistic is perhaps the best advice I can only give, from experience, for the moment... doing things that will help to alleviate the anxiety and, support you in your self care.",Dissociative seizures from PTSD
"A little late to the response here, but I suffer too from PTSD.  As Saving Grace suggests, it's crazy how once you get a diagnosis it can make your anxiety spike.  I have a few autoimmune diseases and I spent two years getting to a diagnosis.  Then I spent a year trying to negotiate that I didn't have them.  Sometimes knowing can make it more difficult.  I see a PTSD counselor and that helped a ton.  For years I did traditional CBT and it was OK.  My PTSD counselor can explain to me some of my strange behaviors and coping mechanisms that are different for people with PTSD versus anxiety/depression.  While it is hard to stay positive, it does help.  I find small steps in a day give me the positivity I need.  I have also learned that I am not super human and need to manage my health conditions more seriously.  Sending healing vibes.  Will be thinking of you.",Dissociative seizures from PTSD
"Hi ChelseaBlue01, Welcome and thank you for posting.  There are so many different symptoms and each person is unique.  I hope you can find helpful tips or content from our Topics section, pinned posts and related posts.  I am sorry you are going through so much. One thing though is that there is hope and things can get better with therapy and different ways of coping.  Thank you for sharing.",Dissociative seizures from PTSD
EMDR is certainly hard core.  I did some sessions and it was successful but I'm living in a current trauma and it's hard to compete with the present and the past.  Hard to say what it is you have.....but you are clearly in a sad place and depression may be a part of the puzzle.  Have you tried any type of talk therapy?  I know how hard it can be to live close.  I get paranoid that I'll see my Ex all of the time!  We co-parent and I literally do not see him on exchanges because it's a trigger for me.  I know more folks will have some good suggestions for you!,Intrusive thoughts of Ex
"I empathize, my ex is 6 blocks away and we live in a small community yet in a big city.  Seeing my ex is a huge trigger for me that can easily turn into a panic attack.  That's how much of a trigger my ex is for me. üò¨",Intrusive thoughts of Ex

"Hi this is my first post to this group.,Ive recently been diagnosed with PTSD after seeing a specialist neuropsychiatrist for Non epileptic attack disorder. I was just wondering if there is anyone on here that also has this diagnosis? im really struggling to accept the PTSD diagnosis and the seizures alone are difficult enough as it is, I feel as though they're only getting worse with the actual diagnosis now. ,Thankyou for reading x","Hi ChelseaBlue01 and welcome to the forum.

"I can‚Äôt get over my ex for the life of me and it‚Äôs almost been a year .  Thoughts pop up of her all day long ,  I get flashbacks of our relationship,  fear at times ,  scared to leave my house since she lives close to me .    What is this ?  Trauma ? PTSD ?  C-PTSD?   It‚Äôs super sad .     I‚Äôve done EMDR and had two sessions and I found that it made me worse.     It wasn‚Äôt the healthiest relationship at all with her Thank you üôè ",EMDR is certainly hard core.
