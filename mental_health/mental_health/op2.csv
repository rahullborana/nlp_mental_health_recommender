"Hello.  I am a 51 y/o man, suffering from Bipolar 2, Diabetes, Arthritis, Hypertension and other health issues.  I have been on various SSRI's and SNRI's since 2002.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2 in 2015.  I have been on Lamotrigine since then and it helped/helps me immensely.  I am finding that antidepressants only work for a while and maybe even cause an increase in anxiety/nervousness, aggression and impulse control issues.  I am wondering if getting off of an antidepressant and adding Seroquel to the Lamotrigine may be a better fit.  What has been your experience?  Thanks for your input.

I went on fluoxetine for a few years and really liked it. I did find that the SSRIs make me feel tired, and quite mellow, but that is so much better than unbearably anxious.  My Drs scaled up my dose pretty slowly so I think that side effects for me were minimized for me when beginning.  When I started my current drug I did feel a great spike in anxiety, but knowing it was just my body adjusting to the new drugs helped me stay calm.  Also, I really hope you are able to do therapy in conjunction with medication. I truly believe that if we can change the way we think we  can change the way we feel.

Not that you may overcome it but may be better able to accept it so you can move on.  It's too soon.  Your emotions are raw. Your thoughts are in high gear.  Changes all around you that you cannot accept yet. This is all normal as to the trauma you have been through.  Lonely but not wanting to be with anyone is a given.  You need the time to figure things out for yourself. And yes, you are the only one who can help you get better.  For a start, unpacking would be a first step. . Living out of a box makes you feel even more lost and possibly unwanted.  Staying in your bedroom all day is not good for the mind or the soul. You are a live and breathing human who needs to feel life around you and not just exist from one day to another.   I would suggest even if you don't go out, to get washed and dressed each day.  When the time is right, you will take that extra step forward and get out.  Looking into the mirror and seeing a more positive mirror of yourself is a start.  No matter how small, it's about one step at a time.   We're here for you.  My best new friend     xx",very depressed

Anxiety is not fun. I have been focusing on getting my nervous system regulated to control the anxiety; stretching and doing whatever movement I can manage every day. Maybe you and your son could do that together? You could even do a kids yoga video! Anything to stretch a bit and get some oxygen flowing through your body will help with both anxiety and depression. Try not to be afraid of your anxiety - the fear is not a fact. Not at all. If you haven't already, look for ways to get grounded/regulate the nervous system. You can do this.  And, try to make a dent in those boxes. Start with a tiny chunk. Work on it for 5 minutes and rest for 5. Continue as you can. Try not to be hard on yourself. Try to give yourself some loving encouragement. Try to take a full, slow breath (count to 4) and a longer, slower exhale (count to 6).  I hope this is helpful. If not, just discard, and please know that you are not alone. There is an epidemic of depression and it is not your fault.  Rooting for you! Christine",very depressed

It is very hard to be separated from your children, especially both at once. the 15-year-old is at an age that there is hope still. They can make a lot of changes as they grow up, even change their minds about their parents. It can take a while, but can happen.  I am writing as someone who went through separation from a baby. It was not caused by anything I had done to the baby, but from a sudden illness. My parents lost their first child permanently, when he wandered away at the age of 3,  fell, hit his head and drowned in a fishpond. That affected them both very deeply for the rest of their lives. It may have been why they argued very loudly almost every day.  I am so sorry you are having to go through this. It can get better, including your mental state, even though you don't, or can't see it.....can't see any possibility of it. There are unexpected things that you wouldn't predict that can still happen and change things. Everything you see and feel us going on at the same time as things you are not even aware of yet. I hope that, and want you to, stick around long enough to find out.",very depressed

There are days I felt I have not understood my daughter.  She is so much immobilized it was painful to watch her suffering.  During this period what I learnt is1. Physical activities helps. 2. Talk therapy helps 3. Facing the situation that gives anxiety helps. 4. When the anxiety / panic attack comes taking rest helps and at the same time rest not necessarily lying on the bed, instead one can watch movies that interests you or visit places which normally you love to visit. 5. Taking regular medicine helps The above are things comes to my mind about anxiety attack.  Regarding her future we don't know how it will unfold. But with the hope that things will improve we are fighting.   At one stage we considered SGB injection as part of treatment which is practiced in Annapolis, MD, USA.  Since we are unable to get some real data we have not taken that route.  If anybody have information on this please share and we still keeping it as option. By reading your post it reminds me of my daughter situation just 18 months ago.  She felt the same way you are feeling now.  Now she is much much better than what she was a year and half ago.  Please keep it in mind it is temporary phase and it will pass and try your best to do physical activities apart from other medical treatment. Please try to talk to your dear ones which will help you a lot.  Unless you talk, the care giver cannot understand you and support you.   I hope the above helps.",very depressed

","Reaching out when you feel down, may not (always) be the solution(s)  but if you get replies from people that can relate to how you feel, that can sometimes make you feel less alone if you get what I'm saying. For example, I'm also alone, I live in a (flat) that's the English name for an (apartment) in America; and over the past twenty plus years, my mental health has been pushed more and more to the point where attempting to end my life increasingly feel like the best option although it isn't. The flat is small in terms of room size;  the design leaves much to be desired, it lacks acoustic sound insulation and so when I go to bed at night in the cramped bedroom, sounds from the other people living in this two storey block can be heard, including the sound of cars and motorbikes going by every few minutes. I now use foam ear plugs every night before settling down to sleep because  it's impossible for me to sleep without them. My flat is also infested by moths, mice, small black flies and blue bottle ones that find their way into my cramped kitchen during the increasingly very humid summer period and both cause me to feel evermore depressed, extremely frustrated, very disillusioned, and it even makes me prone to fits of temper due to what I deal with from day to day, year after year. I think from time to time about how long I'll put up with my lot in life before either having a complete mental breakdown, or finally making an attempt to end my life? I want to carry on living, but without the things mentioned above, and more, that cause me to feel so unhappy. I've had relationships but at the present time I'm single and I sometimes wonder if its better to be on my own or would a relationship prove to be like an outlet, or means of escape from my life here in London? Like you, my self esteem at the present time, is often low and It takes much effort and willpower to get up and go out and even when I do that, I tend to carry the baggage accumulated over the past twenty years with me. I'd like to be able to suggest some practical ways that may help you to get back to how you felt before you felt so down; but at the present time I feel so low and in need of help too. The thought just occurred to me, are your parents nearby to support you? I assume that the mother of your children isn't close to you? Am I right, if you don't mind me asking such a personal question? I asked that because I also think that perhaps she'll be willing to share some time and space to listen and if possible, offer you some practical advice and support. The only other thing I can think of is to seek out a psychologist and tell him or her how you're feeling. Also, I think that talking about your health to a professional, may help you to understand what got you into the position your currently in. Perhaps, you can put your thoughts down in a diary and recall how you were feeling before the anxiety and depression started to grow. Also, I suggest that you ask yourself, what you wanted and expected from life? Did you have expectations then,  that you now realize where perhaps unreasonable or unrealistic in terms of employment, relationship, becoming a father, and human society in general and what it offers to you? How did you feel about yourself when you were a child, and teenager? Where you happy, outgoing, optimistic, ambitious, interested in other people and fascinated by life? Or, was your childhood and teenage years an unhappy experience that perhaps influenced and shaped how you feel and are now? One thing I am certain of is that to feel disillusioned during ones life is natural because human society always consists of imperfect people right across the board from schools, to college, government, family, friends, and even religion. Another thing I think it is useful to remember is that because human society isn't perfect, when problems start to rise, as they inevitable do, we should try to forgive ourselves if we react to them by feeling unhappy, stressed, and frustrated, because that's all down to the way our body is designed. It's natural even though in an ideal world, we should have more reason to feel happy, relaxed, content and optimistic about the present and future. However, the present time, when climate change, political instability, the growing threat of nuclear wars, increase in crime, people increasingly turning against each other, homelessness, drug addictions, the rise in unhealthy lifestyles that can and does lead to extreme obesity, etc, makes it increasingly difficult to have, and maintain peace in our minds and bodies. However, if we figure out our goals and what we want and are able to obtain in in life, and we are aware of the pitfalls that aren't conducive to peace in our minds and bodies, and we pursue things that are healthy and good, as well as accepting that life will always be challenging, we can get through and reach our goals. I think that the first step for you is to find someone to confide in and hopefully support you as you gradually try to work your way back to good mental and physical health and a strong loving relationship with your children and mother. Please feel free to write back if you need someone to confide in. I wish you well. From Trevor in London.",very depressed

I do similar things when I get down - I lose a lot of energy and don't feel I can do anything. The irony is, of course, when we start doing things, like walking, it helps with your emotions.

That's just part of being a teenager! Her seeming distance she keeps from you now might be, in part, to her concern for you with a lack of understanding on her part as to what she can do to help.

Those books had exercises and task and tought me how to improve.  I have always suspected that i needed medication but didnt want it. Back in 2000 i was on antidepressants for a few years but the side affects were too much to handle and opted to cope without them. I put every into fighting. Eating right, getting out in nature, being creative. But there was always this unseen burden on my mind. I was always in a dark cloud. Over the last couple of years i seem to be loosing the mental battle against my depression so i sought the help of a Psychiatrist. He told me the new generation of antidepressants have less to no long-term side effects so i wanted to give medication a go.  I havnt been on them long but i starting to feel like a burden has been lifted. A light has been lit in the darkness. Im beginning to see how i have get out of this.

Hi I am posting to see if anyone else has a similar story with anxiety and maybe see if anyone can give some guidance. I grew up in a very toxic (mentally and physically abusive) household.

The techniques I learned in therapy help with the day to day small problems but when the explosion of anger is happening from the compiled stuff the techniques do not help.

To have men ‚Äúlike‚Äù me through the app gives me confidence I won‚Äôt be alone forever.  There are a lot of emotions that go along with dating apps so be prepared. People do ghost you, so you have to be ready for that, meaning you might talk to them and they will be gone the next time you look for them in the app. You have to look at it as if well at least I didn‚Äôt waste actual time on them. And then there are people who you might match with and they never chat with you. They just like knowing they have lots of people who want to talk to them but have no intention of acting on it.  Some people are only interested in some version of sex so I stay away from them. I am careful what information I give out so someone cannot figure out my identity. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily use it to find your soul mate but it does help with the loneliness.",52 year old lonely man depressed and uncertainty 
"hi all,,I‚Äôm sure you all are going through anxiety and depression otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be here. I hope some one answers me and gives me some advice. I‚Äôm single and live alone after my divorce that I have 3 beautiful children from. I am civil with my ex wife, but I don‚Äôt really have any close close friends rather acquaintances from work or people I‚Äôm not close with. I‚Äôm close with my parents and I do feel alone and uncertain with my life and where I want to be. I want to be with a woman that will be my rock but don‚Äôt know where to start because I‚Äôm not overly charming and I do enjoy talking to people but have been rejected when asking women out at times. I feel I‚Äôm missing that love of my life and want to have that. I don‚Äôt want to be alone the rest of my life and it causes me anxiety and uncertainty and depression. Any suggestions would be helpful and greatly appreciated. Thank you all and God Bless.,","Embrace the aloneness that's what my therapist said and I agree , no one's life is perfect live to lend a hand rather than taking life sad I know it's awful being alone n it's brave to reach out here , best wishes",52 year old lonely man depressed and uncertainty
